# In first iteration, Starting from the first index, compare the first and the second elements. If the first element is greater than the second element, they are swapped
# Now, compare the second and the third elements. Swap them if they are not in order
# The above process goes on until the last element and the same process goes on for the remaining iterations
# After each iteration, the largest element among the unsorted elements is placed at the end.
